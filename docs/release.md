# Release Packaging

Use the packaging script to build a source archive:

```bash
./scripts/create_tarball.sh
```

This produces `Cloudhabil_CLI_patch.tar.gz` in the project root. The archive is excluded from version control; regenerate it as needed rather than committing it.

For pre-built binaries, download releases from the project's GitHub Releases page.
